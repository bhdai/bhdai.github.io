# Personal Blog and AI/Deep Learning learning Journey

This repository serves as the foundation for my personal blog, where i document my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. The primary purpose is to track my progress as I work through the course and dive deeper into the exciting fields.

Through this blog, I aim to:
- Share my insights, reflections, and key learnings from the course
- Document projects, experiments, and applications of AI/DL concepts
- Provide helpful resources and tips for fellow learners
- Showcase my growing skills and knowledge in AI and Deep Learning

Stay tuned for regular updates as I embark on this educational adventure!
