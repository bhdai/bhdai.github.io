Hey! I'm Dai, a final-year Computer Science student at Hanoi University of Industry. Like many CS students these days, I got caught up in the AI wave that's basically taking over the world right now.

This blog is where I document my learning journey and the projects I'm working on. If you're also a student trying to figure out AI and deep learning, or just curious about what I'm up to, feel free to look around!

## What I'm Into

![Where am I](/images/where_am_i.png)

I'm really interested in the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. There's something cool about teaching computers to "see" and understand images. I also dabble in NLP when I have time.

Most of my coding is in Python (obviously, since it's basically the AI language), and I know C from my earlier courses. Still figuring out a lot of things as I go!

## Why I Write Here

Honestly, writing about what I'm learning helps me understand it better. Plus, if someone else finds it useful, that's a bonus! I'm hoping to:

- **Share what I learn**: Maybe save someone else the headache of debugging the same issues I ran into
- **Connect with other students**: Always cool to meet people working on similar stuff
- **Keep track of my progress**: It's nice to look back and see how far I've come

## What's Next

Right now I'm focused on landing a good internship where I can get some real-world AI experience. After that, who knows? Maybe research, maybe industry - I'm keeping my options open and seeing where this journey takes me.


## Current Projects

I'm working on a few things right now, but I'll update this section as I make progress on them. Check back later for more details!
