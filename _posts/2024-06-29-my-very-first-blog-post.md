This is a test post to make sure everything is working correctly with my new blog setup.

## Heading 2

Here's some content under a heading 2. Let's try some formatting:

* Bullet point 1
* Bullet point 2
* Bullet point 3

1. Numbered list item 1
2. Numbered list item 2
3. Numbered list item 3

**This text is bold.**

*This text is italicized.*

And finally, here's some code:

```python
def hello_world(): print("Hello, AI world!")
hello_world()
```

    Hello, AI world!

That's it for this test post. If everything looks good, we're ready to start blogging about AI!
